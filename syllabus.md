# Syllabus Advanced Programming<br>(Spring 2023)

## Description

This course develops students’ ability to write R code to address complex questions that cannot be effectively or efficiently solved with existing R packages. Dealing with such problems often requires using computationally intensive algorithms, requiring sophistication to debug and reduce computing time. Topics covered include writing functions and vectorized programming, debugging, code optimization, parallel computing, C/C++ to R coding, R package creation, command-line programming using Linux, and running jobs on the university’s high-performance computing nodes. Students will learn through seeing (lectures), doing (homework), and teaching (helping one another improve coding). This course is aimed at students with at least moderate proficiency in R programming and/or strong proficiency in another programming language, such as Julia, Python, or C/C++.

## Locations and Times

Lectures: T/Th 11:30 AM - 1:00 pm  
In-person: TBD
Office hours: TBD

## Grading and evaluation

The course will depend heavily on the version control software Git and GitHub for sharing course material and work submissions. We expect students to use dynamic reporting tools such as rmarkdown and quarto. Git, GitHub, and dynamic reporting tools will all be taught during the first sessions of the course.

The course evaluation has four components: class participation, homework assignments, a project midterm (examples [here](https://github.com/UofUEpiBio/PHS7045-advanced-programming/tree/main/projects#example-programming-projects1)), and a final. <span class="underline">Class participation</span> will be measured by lab completion. Students must submit completed labs via GitHub by the Sunday of the instruction week. <span class="underline">Homework assignments</span> will consist of programming problems the student will have to solve and submit as rmarkdown or quarto reports via GitHub. Finally, <span class="underline">midterm and final evaluations</span> will consist of a project where the students should address a programming or computational problem using the tools and methods instructed in this course. Each component weighs into the final grade as follows:

  - Weekly Labs : 15%.

  - Homework Assignments (5) : 9% each for a total of 45%.

  - Midterm project : 20%.

  - Final project : 20%.

Students will present their lab work at least once during the course. There will be <span class="underline">six homework assignments, of which only the top five will be used for the final grade</span>. Besides the written report, <span class="underline">students will present their final project during class</span>. As a general principle, we will grade labs, homework assignments, and projects considering the quality of code documentation, code proficiency and correctness (speed, simplicity, etc.,) and written and oral presentation quality. Details regarding specific evaluation aspects of homework assignments, the midterm project, and the final project will be provided in time. Finally, the grading scale is set as follows:

  - A : 93-100

  - A- : 90-92.9

  - B+ : 88-89.9

  - B : 83-87.9

  - B- : 80-82.9

  - Grades in C - D range are similar to grades in the B range.

  - F : 0-59.9

## Pre-Requisites

Students must be able to write functions and submit homework solutions using R dynamic reporting tools like rmarkdown or quarto. Before the course, students may ask the professor for an example problem to assess their comfort with R programming.
