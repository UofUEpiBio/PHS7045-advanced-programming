## Due date

There are two due dates: Thursday, May 2nd (presentation) and May 4th (R package), 2023.

## Task

This will be an extension of the package submitted for the midterm. The new component will be agreed upon on the week of April 17th.

## Deliverables

* An extension of the package developed for the midterm (70% of grade).
* An oral presentation of no more than seven minutes (30% of grade).

## Requirements

The presentation (May 2nd):

 - The time allocation will be the same as the midterm (7 minutes).

 - It Should be presented with slides (PowerPoint/quarto::revealjs/google slides/etc.)

 - It should have the following structure (roughly):

   a.  Review of the problem which highlights the issue or “why” the problem needs   solving (may consider including visuals to highlight the issue; ~2 slides)

   b.  Overview of the package until the midterm (~1 slide)

   c.  The new feature of the package (~ 1 slide each)

   d.  Problem/motive 

   e.  Solution

   f.  Example

::: {.callout-tip}

(i) Fewer slides than minutes available; if not possible, make sure you spend less than a minute per slide (on average).
(ii) More figures and less text, *i.e.*, avoid paragraphs.
(iii) Avoid diving into the details (or at least, most of your talk should be to the general audience). 
(iv) Focus on what your audience would value the most.
(v) Cluttered slides are never good: It probably needs to be split if they are too long.
:::

```{r}
#| echo: false
fa <- fontawesome::fa("jedi-order")
```

The R package (May 4th `r fa`):

- Add a new function/feature to the R package using parallel computing or `Rcpp` (a must.)

- The package should pass `R CMD check`s using macOS, Ubuntu, and Windows for the R release and development versions (x6 `R CMD check`s). Notes are OK, but warnings are not. 

- The package should pass the `R CMD check` on Ubuntu using the R release version with the option [`--as-cran`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/submission_checklist.html) (more strict `R CMD check`.)




## Grading

The grade will be based on clear communication and coding.
