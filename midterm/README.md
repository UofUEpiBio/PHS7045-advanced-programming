# Midterm


Hackathon: Lecture of October 15th, 2024\
Presentations: Lecture of October 17th, 2024

Report and presentation is due on **October 17th, 2024 AoE**.


## Format

- The midterm consists of a first approach to the final project of the course.

- Students will present the project on October 17th.

- The lecture of October 15th will be replaced with a coding session (aka hackathon) to work on the midterm project alongside the instructors.

- Students will return the midterm (presentation and report) as a GitHub repo dedicated to the midterm project only on October 17th.

- We will provide a template repository for you to use.


## Requirements

The midterm should be posted on a GitHub repository featuring:

- (30% of the grade) A short 5 min presentation.
- (70% of he grade) A report.
- The code should incorporate the content of at least three topics, including:
  - Rcpp
  - Simulation and timing
  - Vectorization
  - data.table
  - parallel computing

### 1.1 Report

- The report should describe two things: A problem/analysis/method to address
using the methods taught in class and a strategy for approaching them.

- The structure should be the following (each equally weighted in the grade):
    - Introduction to the problem (~1 page),
    - Description of the solution plan (~1 page) and
    - Preliminary results (~1 page)

  Reports can exceed the page count to be at most 5 pages (but not less than 3).
    
- Besides of text (~1 page), the preliminary results section should include:
  - Some data (simulated or not), 
  - One or more functions, and
  - The execution of the functions
  

### 1.2 Presentation

- The presentation should be a 5-minute presentation (hard stop).

- The presentation should roughly follow the same structure of the report.

- The presentation should be clear and concise, focusing on the essentials (details like excessive math can be skipped).

- The presentation should be oriented to a general audience (not necessarily technical).
