# Midterm

- There are three products (both built using quarto):
  - (30%) A short 5 min presentation and
  - (70%) A report.
  - (100% -- a must) A repository hosting the project

- The report should describe two things: A problem/analysis/method to address
using the methods taught in class and a strategy about how to approach it.

- The structure should be the following: Introduction to the problem (~1 page),
Description of the solution plan (~1 page) and some example code with prototypes
or a first attack featuring (a) some data (simulated or not), (b) one or more
functions, and (c) the execution of the functions (~1 page of text + outcomes);
the code and figures used can go above that). **Page-count within 3-5**.
The values of the three sections are split evenly (1/3 of the grade each).

- The first day will be a hackathon, and the second will be a presentation.

- The midterm should be on a separate repository than the class's.

The code should incorporate the content of at least three topics, including:

- Rcpp
- Simulation and timing
- vectorization
- data.table
- parallel computing
