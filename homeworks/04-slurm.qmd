# Submitting Jobs to Slurm

## Question 1 

To practice your skills with Slurm, submit the following R code using (a) an `R` script with `sbatch` and (b) using the `slurmR::sourceSlurm` function:

```r
cat(do.call(sprintf, c(
  list("Hello from\njobid: %s\ndir: %s, and\nhost: %s\n"),
  as.list(Sys.getenv(
    c("SLURM_JOB_ID", "SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR", "SLURM_JOB_NODELIST")
  ))
)))
```

We recommend you use the `notchpeak-shared-short` account+partition. Remember that you have to be explicit about the requested resources.

## Question 2

Repeat the previous exercise, but this time request two nodes.
