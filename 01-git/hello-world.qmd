# First level header

## Second level header

Some text that goes along with the document

Code chunks can have tags, like the one here

```{r first-code-chunk}
sqrt(pi)
```

And also, they can have options. For example, if you don't want the source code
to be printed out, you add the option `echo: false` as in the following code
chunk

```{r second-code-chunk}
#| echo: false
plot(USArrests)
```
